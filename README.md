# Geoscripting Final Project
* Title : Sea level rise affect to flooding risk 
* Team : AInil Mardhiah & Jacob Von Grunberg
* Date : 15-01-2020

## Objective
Since 1880, sea level rise has risen slightly about 8-9 inches (21-24 centimeter). The main factor is the global warming phenomena. The global mean water level in the ocean rose by 0.14 inches per year from 2006- 2015. Sea level rise is a serious problem, it could be a thing that can threaten human life, especially people who live in the coastal regions specifically in Jakarta, Indonesia. The flooding risk itself at an alarmingly high rate. Our project's objective is to create scenarios of the impact of sea-level rise on flood risk in Jakarta.

## Data
1. Global mean sea level data. GMSL is generated from the Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate change Research (GMSL dataset), which is a 1-dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA).

2. RCP 4.5. According to RCP database, RCP 4.5 is a stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 by employing a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

3. RCP 8.5. RCP 8.5 depicts the greenhouse gas concentration levels.

4. DEM Jakarta.

5. Boundary data of Jakarta.

File size estimation: up to 150 MB

## Method
To predict Jakarta's drowning risk, we will create three scenarios based on 3 parameters: Global mean sea level, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5. Each scenario will depict the prediction of sea-level rise height in meters.

Program :
Python with several packages : geopandas, numpy , matplotlib 

## Potential Result







# Feedback

Hello, I have read your proposal, and it's a brilliant idea despite the worst cov situation, but it's on another way around that cov give a positive impact to environment. I will give some feedback on your proposal.

1. Task 1, your project's idea is unique and up to date based on the situation now, your background is clear about how to visualize the impact of human activity in industrial and traveling to the clarity of mountain in Nepal now during the covid situation.

2. Task 2, it's good that data requirements are already completed, Copernicus and cloud data from Landsat 8. 
But, I want to confirm several things here : 
a) to predict the significant change of aerosol, how many scenes do you need?
b) For data cloud, since cloud is static data, maybe you can also consider the suitable season or month with the smallest cloud coverage.
c) I am not sure it is important for you; boundary data may also help you focus on your project area.

3. Task 3, you will combine both GEE and R, nice.

Good luck with your project.

Best regards,
Heavenly Defiant Lion
