Exercise 1: Description of your learning objectives and potential project idea
Your task

Submit a max 400 word document about your learning objectives and a potential idea for a project via GitHub as a Markdown (.md) file.
Details

In the description you identify (per team) the idea for which you plan to use Geoscripting:

    The potential contribution of Geoscripting for yourself.
    The specific R or Python knowledge you would need to learn about.
    Describe the data you would like to use for your final project:
        Is the data available?
        What type of data would you like to visualise/analyse?

If you already have a (wild) idea about what you'd like to do during the project week, you can shortly explain it: this will help you make it more concrete in the future!

Keep it short, to the point and structured (e.g. a list of items are OK, no full sentences are needed).

Divide the task between the members of the team. Both members should edit the same file separately and commit the edits to GitHub.

Submit the exercise by opening a pull request to the original repository, with the name of your team as the title of the pull request. The submission deadline is 15:00!
